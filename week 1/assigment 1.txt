1. What is Machine Learning, and Why is it Essential?

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that allows systems to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed. ML is crucial today because it enables automation, enhances decision-making, and drives innovations across various industries.

Real-World Applications:

Healthcare: ML algorithms can analyze medical images to detect diseases early, improving diagnosis and treatment plans.
Finance: ML models predict stock market trends, detect fraudulent transactions, and automate trading strategies.
Customer Service: AI-powered chatbots provide 24/7 support, improving customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

2. Introduction to Python

Python is a versatile programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is popular in data analysis, ML, and AI due to its extensive libraries, supportive community, and ease of learning.

Why Python for AI?

Rich Libraries: Python offers powerful libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn that simplify ML and AI development.
Flexibility: Python can handle various tasks, from data preprocessing to model deployment.
Community Support: A large community of developers contributes to a wealth of resources and continuous improvement.
